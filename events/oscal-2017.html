     <p>OSCAL (<a href="http://oscal.openlabs.cc/" target="blank">Open Source Conference Albania</a>) is the first annual conference in Albania organized to promote software freedom, open source software, free culture and open knowledge, a global movement that originally started more than 25 years ago.</p>

<p>The Conference will take place at 13 & 14 May 2017 in Tirana and will gather free libre open source technology users, developers, academics, governmental agencies and people who share the idea that software should be free and open for the local community and governments to develop and customize to its needs; that knowledge is a communal property and free and open to everyone.<br /> Our mission is educating Albanian youth, and not only, on Free and Open Source Software, its ideology and the great community behind it.</p>
     
     <p>Just like other successful regional conferences OSCAL provides a fertile ground to build and enhance networking within the tech community, both in the local region and worldwide by being used as a meeting point for a network of individuals and companies with the aim of sponsoring and initiating projects which benefit the people and taxpayers in Albania and which should also result in commercial benefits for the surrounding region.</p>

<p>The conference is supported and organized by <a href="http://openlabs.cc/" target="blank">Open Labs</a> , the community that promotes free libre open source culture in Albania since 2012.</p>
     <p><strong>This year Ura is supporting the event as a sponsor, by overviewing the open design process and printings. Members of the OSD community will be there as well, so don’t hesitate to get in touch with us during the event or at the side-events that will happen before and during the weekend.</strong></p>
